"""CSC111 Winter 2022 Prep 3: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains a few functions that you should implement.
Each function represents a recursively-defined mathematical function,
corresponding to one in the starter file prep3_functions.pdf.
(You do not need to modify or submit prep3_functions.pdf, but you'll
need to read it to complete this programming exercise.)

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You do not need to add additional doctests. However, you should test your work carefully
before submitting it!

    TESTING NOTE: because this function makes two recursive calls instead of
    just one, it will be a lot slower than your other functions!
    We recommend testing your work with very small numbers, e.g. m, n <= 5.
