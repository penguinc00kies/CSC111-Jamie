"""CSC111 Winter 2022 Prep 9: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This module contains some functions related to sorting and/or Python lists for practice.
In particular, some of these functions give you practice with *index parameters*,
which we commonly use to specify that a function should only operate on a part of a list.
(This is generally more efficient than requiring the user to create a new list. We'll explor
this idea further in lecture this week.)

Do NOT use recursion for any of these functions.

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You may add additional doctests, but they will not be graded. You should test your work
carefully before submitting it!
