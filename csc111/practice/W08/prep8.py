"""CSC111 Winter 2022 Prep 8: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This module contains the graph implementation we studied in lecture, with a few
additional methods for you to implement on this exercise.

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You may add additional doctests, but they will not be graded. You should test your work
carefully before submitting it!
