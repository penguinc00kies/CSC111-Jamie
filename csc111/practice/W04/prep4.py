"""CSC111 Winter 2022 Prep 4: Programming Exercises

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

Your task in this prep is to implement each of the unimplemented Tree methods in this file.
Use the recursive Tree method code template---decide whether to include the "size-one" base case
by determining whether it would be redundant.

We have marked each place you need to write code with the word "TODO".
As you complete your work in this file, delete each TODO comment.

You may add additional doctests, but they will not be graded. You should test your work
carefully before submitting it!
